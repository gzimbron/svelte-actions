### In View

This action allows you to execute a callback when an element enters the viewport.

```svelte
<script>
	import { inView, type InViewParams } from '@gzim/svelte-actions';

	const inViewParams: InViewParams = {
		callback: () => {
			console.log('Element entered the viewport');
		}
	};
</script>

<section>
	<!-- Lot of scrollable content -->
	<p use:inView={inViewParams}>Your element</p>
</section>
```

### Out of View

This action allows you to execute a callback when an element leaves the viewport.

```svelte
<script>
	import { outOfView, type OutOfViewParams } from '@gzim/svelte-actions';

	const outOfViewParams: OutOfViewParams = {
		callback: () => {
			console.log('Element left the viewport');
		}
	};
</script>

<section>
	<p use:outOfView={outOfViewParams}>Your element</p>
	<!-- Lot of scrollable content -->
</section>
```

### HotKey

This action allows you to execute a callback when a key or combination of keys are pressed.

```svelte
<script>
	import { hotkey } from '@gzim/svelte-actions';
</script>

<section
	use:hotkey={{
		callback: () => {
			console.log('Pressed Alt + P');
		},
		alt: true,
		code: 'KeyP'
	}}
>
	<p>Press Alt/Option + P to execute the callback</p>
</section>
```
